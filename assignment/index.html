<ol>
  <li>While loops and strings really threw me this week. I couldn't figure out how to list the stars using a while loop and wish I'd tried before office hours. How do?! </li>
  <li>When loop logic crashes the browser, it's doubly frustrating because we don't get an error message to help us debug. Are there other tools we can use to help?</li>
